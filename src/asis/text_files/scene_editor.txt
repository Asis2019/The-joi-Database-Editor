The scene editor is where you'll add text, images and other effects.

Scene Image:
By clicking the center of the screen or selecting the Edit > Change Scene Image menu button, you can add an image to
your scene. This image will be the default image for the scene.

Normal Operation:
This tab is always present and cannot be closed. This tab allows you to add text as well as stylize it.
You can also add another image that will only display during the current line.

Timer:
Timers can be added to any scene, the tab allows you to edit the total length of the time and also allows
you to add text at specific times. Like Normal Operation, you can also add images that will only display during
a single second.

Dialog Options:
This tab is very simple and only allows you to create and title basic branching buttons that add new connection points for use
in the main window to connect scenes.

Transition:
This tab is present by default with the default transition settings. Closing this tab will remove any transition from
the scene. This can be used for creating seamless transitions between scenes.
Transitions can also contain a small amount of text that are also styleable.
