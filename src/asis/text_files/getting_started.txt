Creating your own joi is easy once you understand how the editor works. This will be a simple guid on the concepts of scenes and some good practices.

Scenes:
Scenes are the containers that hold everything in your joi. They can be connected to each other in different ways to get different effects.
Right clicking on a scene node will give you some options as too what you can do with them, double clicking them will open the scene editor.

Scene Editor:
The scene editor is where you will spend most of your time, it is where you add lines of text, style the text, add timers, dialog branches, etc.

Project Details:
Pressing this button will open up a window allowing you to edit your joi's information. This window is very important and you should make sure to fill out as much as you can.


Images:
When adding images try to make sure they are at least 900 pixels and no more than 1080 pixels in height.
Since the game runs at 1920 by 1080 pixels, having images that match that resolution will give you the best experience.
Keep in mind that the way something looks in the editor is not necessarily how it will look in the game.
