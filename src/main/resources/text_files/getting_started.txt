Creating your own joi is easy once you understand how the editor works. This will be a simple guide on the concepts of scenes and some good practices.

Scenes:
Scenes are the containers that hold everything in your joi. They can be connected to each other in different ways to get different effects.
Right clicking on a scene node will give you some options as too what you can do with them, double clicking them will open the scene editor.

Scene Editor:
The scene editor is where you will spend most of your time, it is where you add lines of text, style the text, add timers, dialog branches, etc.

Project Details:
Pressing this button will open up a window allowing you to edit your joi's information. This window is very important and you should make sure to fill out as much as you can.


Beats:
The beat system, in its current form, is not setup to help you in anyway. It is perfectly functional, but it is up to you to use it properly.
When using the system, you must enable "Start Beats" for the beats to start and enable "Stop Beats" for the beats to stop.
Beat Speed will change the speed of beats from the current line/second until the next time it is changed. This same rule applies to Beat Pitch as well.
Beat speed is directly related to the games frame rate (60fps) so a beat speed of 30 is 2 beats per second.
The lowest this value can go is 1 which is 60 beats per second. Beat pitch affects the pitch of the beat sound and can be any value from 0 to 5.


Images:
When adding images try to make sure they are at least 900 pixels and no more than 1080 pixels in height.
Since the game runs at 1920 by 1080 pixels, having images that match that resolution will give you the best experience.
Keep in mind that the way something looks in the editor is not necessarily how it will look in the game.
